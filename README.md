# Unexpected TypeError in Javascript This bug demonstrates a common error in Javascript, where functions are called without enough arguments and the result is an unexpected TypeError. The issue arises in the second call to the function `foo`.  The `foo` function expects two arguments (a and b) but is called with only one. When this happens, `b` becomes `undefined`. During the addition `a + b`, Javascript attempts to perform type coercion to convert `undefined` to a number, but it's not a number and this leads to the TypeError. This is a classic example of how Javascript's loose typing can create subtle errors if not handled carefully. The solution involves explicit argument handling, using default values, or argument validation.
